# Data Scraping and Text Analysis Project
## Overview
The Data Scraping and Text Analysis project aims to automate the process of collecting data from websites listed in an input Excel sheet and analyzing the extracted text to derive meaningful insights. The project involves web scraping, data preprocessing, and text analysis techniques to extract relevant information from the web pages and present it in a structured format.

# Project Workflow
 ## Data Scraping:

Input: Excel sheet containing URLs of websites to scrape.
Automation: Utilize web scraping techniques to extract data from the provided URLs.
Output: Raw text data collected from the websites.

## Data Preprocessing:

Remove URLs from the collected text.
Remove punctuation marks.
Perform chat word treatment.
Implement spelling correction.
Tokenization of text.
Removal of stopwords provided in the project specifications.

## Text Analysis:
Calculate positive and negative word counts.
Calculate positive and negative scores.
Calculate polarity score.
Analyze total word count.
Calculate subjectivity score.
Calculate average sentence length.
Identify complex words and calculate their percentage.
Compute Fog Index.
Calculate the average number of words per sentence.
## Output Generation:

Output the analyzed parameters in an Excel sheet format as specified in the project requirements.
Parameters include URL, FileName, positive_words, negative_words, positive_score, negative_score, Polarity_Score, total_words_a_c, Subjectivity_Score, Avg_sent_len, complex_word_count, Percentage_of_Complex_words, Fog_Index, and Average_Number_of_Words_Per_Sentence.
